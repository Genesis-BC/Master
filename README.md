# Genesis Literary Magazine
Boston College's First-Ever First-Generation Magazine

We are tremendously proud to present Genesis, the first literary and art magazine created by and for first-generation students at Boston College. This project is more than a website — it is a space to uplift voices, celebrate creativity, and build community.

# About This Project
This repository contains the source code for the Genesis magazine website. The site showcases student submissions, featured works, and information about our team and mission.

Genesis represents not just artistic expression, but also the resilience and brilliance of first-generation students who are shaping the future of Boston College.
